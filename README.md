# Unix Shell
This was the final team project for a Unix Programming class. I wrote the parser, redirection, myrm, mycp, and mysh. Additionally, I helped my classmate refactor myls. The shell supports pipe & redirection and will also run any of the usual Unix commands. A makefile is included for your convenience, simply “make project” to get started.
